# Electrical Fault detection

Electrical powers system is growing in size and complexity in all sectors such as generation, transmission, distribution and load systems. Types of faults like short circuit condition in power system network results in severe economic losses and reduces the reliability of the electrical system. Electrical fault is an abnormal condition, caused by equipment failures such as transformers and rotating machines, human errors and environmental conditions. Theses faults cause interruption to electric flows, equipment damages and even cause death of humans, birds and animals.

Here the main objective is to find the abnormal patterns between the line current and voltages by this the fault detection system provides a practical and secure way to clear the error in the least possible time.
